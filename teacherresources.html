One national award of $25,000 and four regional awards of $5,000 will be presented at the National Conference on Family Literacy. All 501(c)(3) non-profit organizations, libraries and schools are eligible to apply. Programs should demonstrate innovative and creative use of digital learning in order to increase a parents understanding of the technology and empower them to become actively involved in their child’s education.
