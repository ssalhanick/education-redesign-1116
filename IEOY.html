                        <p>In working directly with middle school, high schools and universities, the World Affairs Council of Dallas/Fort Worth has encountered numerous educators devoted to enriching their students&rsquo; knowledge of world affairs and

                            Educator of the Year Award will provide to the winner a year&rsquo;s membership to the Council and a $500 award.</p>
